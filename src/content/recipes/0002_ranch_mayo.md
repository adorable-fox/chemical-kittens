# Instructions

1.  **Prepare Spice Mix**
    In a small bowl, combine the dried parsley, chives, garlic powder, onion powder, dill, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly. (Note: This makes approx. 2 tablespoons of mix; you only need 1 tablespoon for this recipe).

    In a separate bowl, add the mayonnaise, milk, and lemon juice. Add 1 tablespoon of your prepared ranch spice mix.

3.  **Mix**
    Whisk everything together until smooth and well combined.

    For the best flavor, let the sauce sit in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving.
