# Instructions

1.  **Prep and Blend**
    Drain and wash the chickpeas. Take one-fourth of the chickpeas and blend them with a little water until smooth. Separately, blend the drained tomatoes into a puree.

2.  **Sauté Onions**
    Sauté the red onion in oil on medium heat until soft and starting to caramelise; about 8-10 minutes.

3.  **Aromatics**
    Lower the heat; add the ginger and garlic paste and fry for a few minutes until the raw smell goes away.

4.  **Add Spices**
    Add the salt and the spices (chilli, turmeric, cumin, coriander, cardamom) **except** for the garam masala and kasuri methi. Fry for a short while, taking care not to burn them.

5.  **Cook Masala**
    Add the pureed tomatoes and cook until the oil separates from the masala; about 10 minutes.

6.  **Combine**
    Add the chickpea puree and mix thoroughly, then add the remaining whole chickpeas.

7.  **Simmer**
    Add water to reach your desired consistency and cook on low heat for another 10 minutes.

8.  **Finish**
    Finish the dish by stirring in the garam masala and crushed kasuri methi.
