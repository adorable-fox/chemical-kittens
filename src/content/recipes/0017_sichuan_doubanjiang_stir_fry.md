# Instructions

1.  **Prepare Sauce**
    In a small bowl, mix the sauce ingredients: doubanjiang, 3 tablespoons of oil, chili flakes, Sichuan pepper, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, and sesame oil.

2.  **Marinate Chicken**
    In a separate bowl, mix the chicken pieces with the potato starch, sesame oil, and Shaoxing wine.

3.  **Sear Chicken**
    Heat a wok until very hot, then lower the heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil and swirl it around. Add the chicken and let it sear, undisturbed, on one side. When lightly browned, continue stir-frying until just cooked through, then remove and reserve.

4.  **Stir-fry Vegetables**
    Clean the wok if needed, return to heat, and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the courgette chunks and water chestnuts; stir-fry over high heat until they start to brown but are still crisp. Add the garlic slices and cook briefly.

5.  **Cook Sauce**
    Lower the heat, push the vegetables to the sides of the wok, and add the prepared sauce into the center. Cook it briefly to release the aromas.

6.  **Combine**
    Add back the cooked chicken and mix all ingredients well. If the mixture is too dry, add a little water to reach your desired consistency.
