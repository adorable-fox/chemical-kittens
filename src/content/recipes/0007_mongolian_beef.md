# Instructions

Mix sliced beef with 1 tsp oil, 1 tsp soy sauce, and 1 tbsp potato starch. Marinate for one hour. In a small bowl, mix the following sauce ingredients: brown sugar, minced garlic and ginger, soy sauce, and hot water.


Coat the marinated beef in the remaining 2 tbsp of potato starch, then fry in oil on high heat until crispy. Transfer to a plate, wipe the pan, add fresh oil. Fry the dried red chillies for a short while, taking care to not burn them. Remove the chillies if desired, then add the premixed sauce to the pan. Cook until the raw smell of garlic and ginger disappears; about two minutes. Add the potato starch slurry to thicken the sauce, then add beef. Toss until warmed through and evenly coated in sauce. Remove from the pan, garnish with sliced spring onions and serve with rice.
