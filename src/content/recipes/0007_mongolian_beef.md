# Instructions

1.  **Marinate Beef**
    Mix the sliced beef with 1 tsp oil, 1 tsp soy sauce, and 1 tbsp of the potato starch. Let it marinate for one hour.

2.  **Prepare Sauce**
    In a small bowl, mix the following sauce ingredients: brown sugar, minced garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and hot water.

3.  **Coat and Fry**
    Coat the marinated beef in the remaining 2 tbsp of potato starch, then fry in oil on high heat until crispy. Transfer to a plate.

4.  **Fry Chillies**
    Wipe the pan clean and add fresh oil. Fry the dried red chillies for a short while, taking care not to burn them. Remove the chillies if desired (or leave them in for heat).

5.  **Cook Sauce**
    Add the premixed sauce to the pan. Cook until the raw smell of garlic and ginger disappears; about two minutes.

6.  **Thicken**
    Add the potato starch slurry to the pan to thicken the sauce.

7.  **Combine**
    Add the crispy beef back into the pan. Toss until warmed through and evenly coated in the sticky sauce.

8.  **Serve**
    Remove from the pan, garnish with sliced spring onions, and serve with rice.
