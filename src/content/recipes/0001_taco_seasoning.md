# Instructions

1.  **Mix Spices**
    Mix all the spices thoroughly in a small bowl or jar. The listed weights are suitable for 500g of meat.

2.  **Brown Meat**
    To make tacos, brown ground beef in a little oil until cooked through. Drain the excess fat once done.

3.  **Bloom Spices**
    Reduce the heat, add the prepared seasoning mix, and stir well. Fry for a short while to release the flavors, taking care not to burn the spices.

4.  **Simmer**
    Add 100-120ml of water and cook until the liquid has evaporated.
