# Instructions

Fry the chopped pancetta with olive oil. Finely chop the onion, celery, and carrot; add the vegetables to the oil and pancetta and cook over low heat, stirring constantly until softened but not browned. Raise the heat to medium and add the meat, break it up, then cook for about ten minutes, always stirring, until it sizzles and browns. Add the wine; cook over medium heat until it has completely evaporated. Add the tomato paste and tomatoes. Mix well; add a cup of boiling stock and simmer, covered, for about 3 hours, adding hot broth (or water) as needed. Add milk half way through the cooking. Season with salt and pepper before serving.
