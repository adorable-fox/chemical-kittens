# Instructions

1.  **Prepare the Base**
    Fry the chopped pancetta with the olive oil. Finely chop the onion, celery, and carrot.

2.  **Sauté Vegetables**
    Add the vegetables to the oil and pancetta and cook over low heat, stirring constantly until softened but not browned.

3.  **Brown Meat**
    Raise the heat to medium and add the ground beef. Break it up with a spoon, then cook for about ten minutes, stirring always, until it sizzles and browns.

4.  **Deglaze**
    Add the wine and cook over medium heat until it has completely evaporated.

5.  **Add Tomatoes**
    Add the tomato paste and the strained chopped tomatoes. Mix well.

6.  **Simmer**
    Add a cup of boiling stock and simmer, covered, for about 3 hours. Check periodically and add more broth (or water) as needed.

7.  **Add Milk**
    Add the milk halfway through the cooking time (after about 1.5 hours).

8.  **Season and Serve**
    Season with salt and pepper to taste before serving.
