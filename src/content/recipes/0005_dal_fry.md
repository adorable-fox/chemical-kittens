# Instructions

Wash lentils in cold water until it runs clear, then cook until fairly mushy, about 40 minutes. In another pan, start heating some ghee or oil with mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and dried red chillies, until they start to splutter. Add chopped onion and fry for few minutes. Lower the temperature, add minced ginger and garlic; fry for a few minutes. Reduce the temperature and add turmeric, chilli powder, coriander powder, and salt. Add chopped tomato and saute until mushy and oil starts to separate. Add the cooked lentils and mix well. Fry until required consistency adding water as needed.
