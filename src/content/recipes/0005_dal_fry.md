# Instructions

1.  **Cook Lentils**
    Wash lentils in cold water until it runs clear, then cook until fairly mushy, about 40 minutes.

2.  **Temper Spices**
    In another pan, start heating some ghee or oil with mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and dried red chillies, until they start to splutter.

3.  **Sauté Aromatics**
    Add chopped onion and fry for a few minutes. Lower the temperature, add minced ginger and garlic; fry for a few minutes.

4.  **Add Ground Spices**
    Reduce the temperature further and add turmeric, chilli powder, coriander powder, and salt.

5.  **Cook Tomatoes**
    Add chopped tomato and saute until mushy and the oil starts to separate from the masala.

6.  **Combine and Simmer**
    Add the cooked lentils and mix well. Fry and simmer until the required consistency is reached, adding water as needed.

7.  **Finish**
    Once finished, add garam masala and crushed kasuri methi.

8.  **Serve**
    Garnish with fresh coriander.
