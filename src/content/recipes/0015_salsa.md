# Instructions

1.  **Prepare Vegetables**
    Cut the tomatoes and the onion in half. Spread them cut-side down on a baking tray lined with aluminium foil.

2.  **Wrap Aromatics**
    Wrap the garlic cloves and chili peppers in a small piece of aluminium foil to prevent them from burning, and place this packet on the tray.

3.  **Roast**
    Roast in the oven for 25 minutes at 180°C (fan).

4.  **Blend**
    Allow the vegetables to cool. You can discard or leave the tomato skins according to your preference. Place the roasted tomatoes, onion, garlic, and chilies into a blender or food processor and blend until combined but slightly chunky.

5.  **Season**
    Transfer to a bowl. Add the chopped coriander, squeeze in lime juice, and season with salt to taste. Mix well.

6.  **Serve**
    The salsa is ready to eat straight away, though I usually refrigerate it for a while to let the flavors meld.
