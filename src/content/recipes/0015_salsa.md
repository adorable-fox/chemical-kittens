# Instructions

Cut tomatoes and an onion in half and spread cut side down in a tray lined with aluminium foil. Wrap garlic and chillies in an aluminium foil. Roast in an oven for 25 mins @ 180C fan. Discard or leave tomato skins according to preference and blend everything together once cooled. Add chopped coriander, lime juice, and salt to taste. Mix well. I usually refrigerate for a while, but it's ready to eat straight away.
