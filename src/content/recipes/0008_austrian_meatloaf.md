# Instructions

1.  **Soak the Bread**
    Pour the 250ml of milk over the 200g of bread cubes and let them soak for about 10 minutes.

2.  **Preheat**
    Preheat the oven to 180°C.

3.  **Sauté Aromatics**
    Saute the finely chopped onion and parsley in a little oil until soft.

4.  **Mix**
    In a large bowl, thoroughly mix the ground meat, sauteed onion and parsley, soaked bread cubes, egg, salt, pepper, and marjoram. If the mixture is not sticking together, add some dry breadcrumbs.

5.  **Form and Pan**
    Form the meat into a loaf shape and place in a casserole dish.

6.  **Bake**
    Pour some of the heated beef broth into the dish (around the meat) and place in the heated oven for about 60 minutes.

7.  **Baste**
    Check every 15 minutes to baste the loaf with the pan juices and add more beef broth; make sure there is always liquid in the oven dish.

8.  **Serve**
    We usually serve it with sliced boiled potatoes or a potato salad.
