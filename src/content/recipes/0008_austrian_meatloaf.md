# Instructions

Pour the milk over the bread cubes and let them soak for about 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C. Saute the onion and parsley in oil. In a large bowl, thoroughly mix the meat, onion and parsley, soaked bread cubes, egg, salt, pepper, and marjoram. If the mixture is not sticking together add some breadcrumbs.


Form the meat into a loaf shape and place in a casserole dish. Pour some of the heated beef broth into the dish and place in the heated oven for about 60 minutes. Check every 15 minutes to baste with more beef broth; make sure there is always liquid in the oven dish. We usually serve it with sliced boiled potatoes or a potato salad.
