# Instructions

1.  **Mix Dry Ingredients**
    Mix the spices (chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, cinnamon) with the salt and flour thoroughly in a small bowl.

2.  **Make Roux**
    Heat the oil in a medium-sized pan over medium heat. Add the flour and spice mixture. Whisk constantly and cook until fragrant and slightly darkened; about 1 minute.

3.  **Cook Tomato Paste**
    Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute, whisking to combine.

4.  **Simmer**
    Add the broth in small portions, whisking constantly to remove any lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened slightly.

5.  **Finish**
    Remove from the heat and stir in the apple cider vinegar.
