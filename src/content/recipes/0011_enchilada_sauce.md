# Instructions

Mix the spices with salt and flour thoroughly.

Heat the oil in a medium-sized pan over medium heat. Add the flour and spice mixture. Whisk constantly and cook until slightly darkened; about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute. Add the broth in small portions, whisk to remove any lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce thickened a bit. Remove from the heat and add the vinegar.
