# Instructions

Mix the spices thoroughly. Listed weights are suitable for 2 chicken breasts, 1 bell pepper, 1 medium/large red onion.


To make fajitas, marinade chicken in 1 tsp of oil and the spice mix. Fry on medium/high heat until no longer pink, or longer if desired. Remove chicken from the pan; add vegetables and cook stirring constantly until softened but still a bit crunchy. Add the chicken back to the pan and heat through. Serve on small tortillas.
