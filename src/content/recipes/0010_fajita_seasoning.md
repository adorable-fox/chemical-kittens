# Instructions

1.  **Mix Spices**
    Mix the spices thoroughly. The listed weights are suitable for 2 chicken breasts, 1 bell pepper, and 1 medium/large red onion.

2.  **Marinate and Cook Chicken**
    To make fajitas, marinate the chicken in 1 tsp of oil and the prepared spice mix. Fry on medium/high heat until no longer pink, or longer if you prefer a char.

3.  **Cook Vegetables**
    Remove the chicken from the pan. Add the vegetables (peppers and onions) and cook, stirring constantly, until softened but still a bit crunchy.

4.  **Combine and Serve**
    Add the chicken back to the pan and heat through. Serve on small tortillas.
