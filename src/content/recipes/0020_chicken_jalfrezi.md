# Instructions

1.  **Marinate**
    In a bowl, mix the chicken with the lemon juice, 1/4 tsp salt, black pepper, and 1/2 tsp Kashmiri chili powder. Keep aside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

2.  **Sauté Base**
    Heat the oil in a pan and add the **100g finely chopped onion**. Fry on medium-high heat until golden. Lower the heat, add the ginger and garlic paste, and sauté for a minute.

3.  **Seal Chicken**
    Add the marinated chicken and stir-fry on medium-high heat for about 3 to 4 minutes, until it turns pale.

4.  **Add Spices**
    Stir in the spices: Kashmiri red chili powder, regular chilli powder, turmeric, garam masala, coriander powder, cumin powder, fennel powder, and the **1 tsp salt**.

5.  **Cook Masala**
    Pour in the **drained chopped tomatoes**. Mix well and let cook until the oil begins to separate from the masala.

6.  **Simmer with Veg**
    Pour in the hot water and mix well. Immediately add the **diced onions (70g)** and **diced bell peppers (160g)**. Cook covered on medium heat until the chicken is tender and the vegetables are cooked but still retain some crunch.

7.  **Finish**
    When the chicken is fully cooked and the sauce is thick, add the kasuri methi. Stir well and cook for 1 to 2 minutes on high heat to evaporate any excess liquid if necessary. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with rice.
