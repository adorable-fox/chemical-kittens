# Instructions

1.  **Sauté Onion**
    In a large pan over medium heat, melt 2 tbsp of butter. Add the finely chopped onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned (not fried).

2.  **Add Garlic**
    Add the minced garlic and cook for a few minutes until fragrant.

3.  **Caramelize Paste**
    Add the tomato paste and chilli flakes. Cook, stirring frequently, until the paste has coated the onion and garlic and is beginning to darken; about 5 minutes.

4.  **Deglaze**
    Add the vodka to the pan and stir to incorporate. Cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.

5.  **Cook Pasta**
    Meanwhile, cook the pasta in salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve some starchy pasta water before draining.

6.  **Finish Sauce**
    Add the double cream to the sauce along with a splash of the reserved pasta water. Add half of the parmesan and stir until melted and smooth.

7.  **Combine**
    Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and stir to coat thoroughly. Add more pasta water if the sauce needs loosening.

8.  **Serve**
    Serve immediately, topped with the remaining parmesan and fresh basil.
