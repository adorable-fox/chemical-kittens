# Instructions

1.  **Drain Tofu**
    Press the tofu squares between paper towels to drain the water.

2.  **Mix Sauce**
    Mix all the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl.

3.  **Coat Tofu**
    When ready to cook, pat the tofu dry with fresh paper towels and mix with the potato starch until evenly coated.

4.  **Fry Tofu**
    Fry the coated tofu on high heat in oil until crispy and golden. Remove from the pan and set aside.

5.  **Stir Fry Vegetables**
    Add more oil to the pan if needed. Stir fry the onions and red peppers for a very short while so they soften a little bit but retain crunch.

6.  **Thicken Sauce**
    Add the mixed sauce to the pan and cook until it thickens; usually 1 or 2 minutes.

7.  **Combine**
    Add the fried tofu back to the pan and toss until warmed through and evenly coated in the sticky sauce.

8.  **Serve**
    Garnish with sesame seeds or chopped green onions and serve with rice.
