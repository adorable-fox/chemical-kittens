# Instructions

Press the tofu squares between paper towels to drain the water. Mix the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. When ready to cook, pat tofu dry with more paper towels and mix with potato starch until evenly coated. Fry on high heat in oil until crispy and remove from the pan. Add more oil to the pan if needed, and stir fry onions and red peppers for a very short while so they soften a little bit. Add the sauce and cook until it thickens; 1 or 2 minutes. Add the tofu to the pan and toss until warmed through and coated in sauce. Garnish with sesame seeds or chopped green onions and serve with rice.
